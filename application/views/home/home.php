		Welcome to ProjectSpot! ProjectSpot is a place for you to find MQP groups. 
		Search through individual students looking for MQPs, or search through project 
		groups that still need members. You can also see advisors and the projects they 
		are offering that they need students for.
	</p>
	<p>
		To get started with ProjectSpot, login through CAS with  your WPI username and password.
	</p>

	<p>
		ProjectSpot is for both students and advisors! Advisors can set up multiple MQP groups
		looking for members in ProjectSpot. Students can only be a part of one MQP group at a time.
